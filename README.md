By Elton Vinh

Please enter an arithmetic expression separated by spaces.

i.e.  sin ( 3 + 4 * 2 / ( 1 - 5 ) ^ 2 ^ 3 )
Supports +, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan

Calculator also supports the use of variable storage and assignment.

Type 'assignments' to see variables stored.

There are some bugs. But for the most part it works pretty well.

To run you must have leiningen installed and use the command "lein run" @ the project path.
